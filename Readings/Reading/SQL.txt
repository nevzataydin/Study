ACID, Defined
Each of the four ACID attributes follow well-defined standards:

Atomicity 
states that database modifications must follow an “all or nothing” rule. Each transaction is said to be atomic. 
If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails. It is critical that the database management 
system maintains the atomic nature of transactions in spite of any DBMS, operating system, or hardware failure.

Consistency 
states that only valid data will be written to the database. If, for some reason, a transaction is executed 
that violates the database’s consistency rules, the entire transaction will be rolled back, and the database 
will be restored to a state consistent with those rules. On the other hand, if a transaction successfully 
executes, it will take the database from one state that is consistent with the rules to another state that 
is also consistent with the rules.

Isolation 
requires that multiple transactions occurring at the same time not impact each other’s execution. For example, 
if Joe issues a transaction against a database at the same time that Mary issues a different transaction, both 
transactions should operate on the database in an isolated manner. The database should either perform Joe’s 
entire transaction before executing Mary’s, or vice-versa. This prevents Joe’s transaction from reading 
intermediate data produced as a side effect of part of Mary’s transaction that will not eventually be committed 
to the database. Note that the isolation property does not ensure which transaction will execute first—merely 
that transactions will not interfere with each other

Durability 
ensures that any transaction committed to the database will not be lost. Durability is ensured through the use 
of database backups and transaction logs that facilitate the restoration of committed transactions in spite of 
any subsequent software or hardware failures.
