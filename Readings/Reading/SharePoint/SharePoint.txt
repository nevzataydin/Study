SharePoint Feature
	-A functional component (like search, navigation, custom code)
	-can be activated and deactivated at scopes 
	-Feature defines menu commands, page templates, link commands, 
	page instances, list instances, list definitions, event handlers, etc.
	-Can be defined with 
		-elements.xml: it makes SP aware of features installed 
		-feature.xml: includes details of feature functionality

Timer Job
	-yes: 13, 16, 19 no: 365
	-timer job runs in a specific Windows service for SharePoint Server
	-The SharePoint Timer service (SPTimerv4) runs timer jobs.
	-does infrastructure tasks
	-perform tasks for web applications
	-A timer job contains a definition of the service to run and specifies how frequently the service is started

https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/introduction-of-sharepoint-event-receivers/
Event Receivers.
	Resides
		By default, Event Receivers are asynchronous - they run under the SharePoint Timer Service (OWSTIMER.exe). 
	Method triggers when an action occures
		Adding
		Updating
		Deleting
		Moving
		Checking In
		Checking Out.
	Types
		Synchronous Event Receiver
			Before events fire before the corresponding event action occurs and before SharePoint has written any data to the content database.
		Asynchronous Event Receiver	
			After events fire after the event action has completed and after SharePoint has written to the content database to commit the event action.
	Classes
		Base class: Microsoft.SharePoint.SPEventReceiverBase.
		Base class for List Item: Microsoft.SharePoint.SPItemEventReceiver
		Base class for SharePoint List: Microsoft.SharePoint.SPListEventReceiver
		Base class for Email: Microsoft.SharePoint.SPEmailEventReceiver
	Base Classes
		SPItemEventReceiver
		SPListEventReceiver
		SPEmailEventReceiver
		SPWebEventReceiver
		SPWorkflowEventReceiver
		SPFeatureReceiver
			Activated-Deactivated
			Installed-Uninstalled
			Upgrading
	Cancel event (with synchronous)
		public override void ItemAdding(SPItemEventProperties properties) {  
			base.ItemAdding(properties); 
			properties.Cancel = True; 
	Scope
		ListUrl works only if feature has Scope=”Web”. In case the feature has Scope=”Site”, event receiver is fired for every list and library, ListUrl is ignored

Search
	https://sharepointadmintrick.blogspot.com/2016/03/difference-between-basic-search-center.html
	Basic vs Enterprise
		-main difference is customizing
		Basic Search:
			-crawl on site and lists
			-results shown on a not easily customizable page
			-cannot show results in other places
		Enterprise Search:
			-crawl on basic + across site collection and web applications
			-very customizable serch page, show results in other places
			-better scalability
		FAST Search
			-basic + document previes, deep refiners, user context, visual best bets
			-much more highly scalable than basic
		Hybrid Search
			-Crawl file and documents across SP on premises and 365
			-Cloud hybrid: index is on cloud
			-Hybrid federated: two indexes on both sides
	Databases
		Crawl: Stores tracking information and historical information about 
			crawled items such as documents and URLs
		Link: Stores unprocessed information that is extracted by the content 
			processing component and information about search clicks.
		Analytics reporting: Stores the results of usage analysis.
		Search admin: Stores search configuration data.
	Why to scale search topology
		content or user numbers increased
		Search solution could have a bottleneck
		Performance requirements changed.
	How to scale
		Redesign Questions
			How much content do i have
			What size search architecture should I scale to
			Hardware requirements
	Search Database Topologies
		-There must be paired hosts (replicas) for fault tolerance
		-Small Topology
			-Host A
				-Application Server 1
					-Query Processing
					-Replica (index partition 0)
				-Application Server 2	
					Crawl
					Admin
					Analytics
					Content Processing
			-Host H
				-Databasees
					Search Admin DB
					Link DB
					Crawl DB
					Analytics DB
		-Medium Topology
			-Host A (x2 => 4 index)
				-Application Server 1
					-Query Processing
					-Replica  (index partition 0)
				-Application Server 2
					-Replica  (index partition 1)
			-Host C
				-Application Server 1
					-Analytics
					-Content Processing
				-Application Server 2
					-Crawl
					-Admin
					-Content Processing
			-Host H (as above)
		-Large Topology
			-10 indexes
			-more distrubited analytics, Content, Crawl, Admin
		-Extra Large Topology
			-25 indexes
			-every service is seperated
				1x Query Processing
				2x Crawl
				1x Admin
				3x Content Processing
				2x Analytics
